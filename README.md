# React.js Form Application

This project is a dynamic and user-friendly form application developed using modern web development tools. The main technologies used in this project are React.js, Formik, Yup, and i18n.

## Features

- **React.js**: A component-based JavaScript library used for building the application's user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Formik**: A powerful library for managing and validating form state. Formik simplifies the process of handling form data and user inputs.
- **Yup**: A validation library that works seamlessly with Formik to ensure the accuracy and validity of form inputs. With Yup, we define various validation rules.
- **i18n**: Provides internationalization support, making the application usable in multiple languages. Users can switch between different languages to fill out the form in their preferred language.
